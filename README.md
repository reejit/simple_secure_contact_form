***Kontact PHP Mail Contact Form Mailer***


I am trying to build a simple, secure php mail contact form to integrate into existing HTML page.
This is a work in progress with many features I am planning on implementing.
Right now, you can specify a webiste URL, image location and it will format a nice little Table with image and link goodness wrapped right in.
Check it out, give feedback and help out if you would like.

I did include the script to try an determine the senders "TRUE" email address to email with message to easily copy/paste email address and add to blacklist if they are spammers

***Wanted Features (ATPIT):***

Multiple Choices for Captcha Options

Skinable emails

More ideas to come

Thank you and enjoy ... 


***Installation***:
Installation is quite simple. Copy included .html pages to your webroot, edit accordingly to match your existing site look and upload rest of content into a folder named kontact (I spelled it wrong on purpose) and edit kontact_mail.php according to your needs. It should work right out of the box with Google ReCaptcha (as long as you go get your keys) and a Dark Blue / Light Blue table formatted themed email sent to the email of your choice.
